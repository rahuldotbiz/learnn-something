Java is a general-purpose programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has been implemented on many platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac OS.

Java can be used to create desktop applications, Web-based applications and mobile apps (Android).

The best way to learn Java is with a good course on Udemy or some other platform. There are many free resources on the Internet . You should also consider learning Java if you want to become a software developer.

Java is still a great language to learn in 2023 but it’s important to understand that there are many alternatives like Python or C++ that can be used for similar purposes but with different tradeoffs.

If you are interested in learning more about Java, I will share some resources that might be useful.
