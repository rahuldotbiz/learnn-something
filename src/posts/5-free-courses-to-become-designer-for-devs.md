# Designing is solving problems

Designing is the process of solving problems, finding the best solution to a problem. Designers have to take an idea and turn it into an actual product. They have to find what works for their clients, whether it’s a website or a car.

Designing is about making something better than what was before — and not just by adding features or improving aesthetics (although those are important). It’s also about making things easier or more efficient at some level; this can mean simplifying your interface so that users don’t need too many steps in order to get something done.

# Design is its own form of communication

Design is a form of communication. It uses visual cues to convey meaning and can be used to explain your design choices, but it’s also just as effective at communicating ideas without words. In fact, designers use typography and color palettes in order to convey their message more clearly than words alone could ever hope to do.

Design is solving problems Design is all about solving problems. It’s about finding ways to make things easier, more efficient and more enjoyable for people who will use your product or service. It doesn’t matter if you’re designing a website or an app; all designers are problem-solvers by nature.

# You’ll gain a new understanding of the world around you

Design is a way to understand and make sense of the world around you. It helps you understand how things work, the relationship between people and things, and how people interact with each other.

-   Designing helps you make sense of your world by giving it structure, which enables you to find meaning in what seems chaotic or confusing.
-   It also allows designers to play with ideas that might otherwise never be understood because they’re too complex for anyone else (or even themselves).

# Design follows the scientific method

Design is a process, not an end result. It’s a series of steps that take you through the steps that make up your design problem.

Design is iterative: You start with an idea and refine it based on feedback from others (or yourself) until you have something that works well enough for its purpose or context.

Design is a way to make sense of the world: You can use it as an analytical tool to explore complex problems and come up with solutions — and this can be especially important when designing products like software or websites because they require lots of input from users before they’re finished!

# Learning to design teaches you how to innovate

Design is a process of innovation. It’s how you go from an idea to a solution, from “I have an idea” to “I’ve made it.”

Designers have been called upon to solve problems for centuries — the key question being: “How do I get this done?” designing something new or fixing something old? In today’s world, most problems don’t come from lack of materials or tools but rather our inability to understand them well enough (or at all!) in order for us to make a difference.

Designing does not just mean making pretty things; it involves solving problems and communicating effectively with others about those solutions so that everyone benefits from them equally.
